After taking loans from the bank, some people are unable to repay their borrowed amount,
resulting in a loss to the bank.
<h2>What can be done?
The aim of this project is to try to predict if someone will be a ‘defaulter’ i.e. would be unable
to repay the loan.
This will be done by analysing a given dataset consisting of various information about the
previous borrowers (viz. Age, Employment status,credit score, etc.) and whether they were
able to pay back the loan or not.
We will then be using a Neural network to fabricate a model which would predict if someone
would be a defaulter, thus, helping the bank in deciding whether loan should be given or not.
